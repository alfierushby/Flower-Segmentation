\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This paper focuses on the aspect of two attempts to segment flowers in a small dataset called Oxford Flower Dataset \autocite{nilsbackVisualVocabularyFlower2006}. The specific dataset is of around 750 flowers, with various species, where the images themselves each contain one flower. The difficulty, then, is to create a consistent solution to segmenting these flowers with the background. These flowers have varying viewpoints, colours, lighting, posing, shape, etc, and so the act of 'knowing' what a flower is with so much variance is very difficult.
\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:format}

This specific dataset has seen classical attempts at segmenting the flowers. The method uses an approximate segmentation with learned distributions for the background and foreground, and then it iterates on improving the foreground segmentation through using a geometric model of what a flower should look like, until it can converge onto some flower segmentation \autocite{nilsbackDelvingDeeperWhorl2010}. This specific method achieved its performance through a rudimentary learning method, which is by using a set of sample images to create a 'learned' distributions. 

The method is affine invariant, but is still susceptible to colour/lighting variations. To circumvent this, a deep learning approach can be used to expand on the early uses of learning from data, specifically a U-net \autocite{ronnebergerUNetConvolutionalNetworks2015}. This expands on the principle by iteratively learning a set of filters that extract progressively more abstract features as you go down the first half of the network with lowering spatial information. The idea then is that these features would only encode the flower and background, or something useful to then be upscaled with another set of filters into an output segmentation, specifically up-convolutions.

This method removes the need for any assumptions on how a flower is structured, as the entire 'structure' and the concept of a 'flower' is learnt in the fast half. The only downside with this method is its dependence on data, where the quality and quantity of this data affects the performance to a great extent. 

Another method, SegNet \autocite{badrinarayananSegNetDeepConvolutional2017}, exists, with the main differentiator being that it doesn't use convolutions to upscale directly, and uses pooling indexes to help with the upsampling. This isn't as popular as U-Net because it isn't as direct in learning the upscaling sequence with convolutions. 

All of these methods requires data, and the learning of the first section, the downsampling that lowers the spatial resolution progressively, is the same as any classification CNN, like AlexNet or ResNet \autocite{krizhevskyImageNetClassificationDeep2012,heDeepResidualLearning2016}. Training these networks often uses methods like Batch Normalisation, which prevents neuron outputs from spiralling into massive values \autocite{ioffeBatchNormalizationAccelerating2015}, and Dropout, which make the network more robust and lessen overfitting by disabling parts of the network during training \autocite{srivastavaDropoutSimpleWay2014}. 

Smaller dataset training in particular has popular configurations for maximizing training efficiency. Along with what has been spoken of, Data Augmentation is another method to expand the dataset by applying affine transformations, along with possible colour variations. This has been shown to reduce overfitting \autocite{shortenSurveyImageData2019} by increasing the model's generalization (through a larger dataset).

These methods can be used together in specific ways to maximize the usefulness in small dataset applications, where the additional concept of injecting this data augmentation technique in the middle of training can maximize its effectiveness \autocite{thanapolReducingOverfittingImproving2020}. 

It is also possible to transfer learn, or fine tune pre-trained models to use their more general convolutions as a boost in training, where a pre-trained set of weights for the down-convolution can help it lock into a useful area of search on the onset. It has been shown that pre-training helps with generalizing performance by finding a better 'minima' in loss \autocite{pmlr-v9-erhan10a}.


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:pagestyle}

The paper title (on the first page) should begin 1.38 inches (35 mm) from the
top edge of the page, centred, completely capitalized, and in Times 14-point,
boldface type.  The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title
in capital and lower case letters.  Papers with multiple authors and
affiliations may require two or more lines for this information. Please note
that papers should not be submitted blind; include the authors' names on the
PDF.

\section{TYPE-STYLE AND FONTS}
\label{sec:typestyle}

To achieve the best rendering both in printed proceedings and electronic proceedings, we
strongly encourage you to use Times-Roman font.  In addition, this will give
the proceedings a more uniform look.  Use a font that is no smaller than nine
point type throughout the paper, including figure captions.

In nine point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high.  {\bf If you use the
smallest point size, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch)
vertically.}  This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make
the paper much more readable.  Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger
vertical spacing.  Please do not double-space your paper.  TrueType or
Postscript Type 1 fonts are preferred.

The first paragraph in each section should not be indented, but all the
following paragraphs within the section should be indented as these paragraphs
demonstrate.

\section{MAJOR HEADINGS}
\label{sec:majhead}

Major headings, for example, "1. Introduction", should appear in all capital
letters, bold face if possible, centered in the column, with one blank line
before, and one blank line after. Use a period (".") after the heading number,
not a colon.

\subsection{Subheadings}
\label{ssec:subhead}

Subheadings should appear in lower case (initial word capitalized) in
boldface.  They should start at the left margin on a separate line.
 
\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
\label{sssec:subsubhead}

Sub-subheadings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged. However, if you
must use them, they should appear in lower case (initial word
capitalized) and start at the left margin on a separate line, with paragraph
text beginning on the following line.  They should be in italics.

\section{PRINTING YOUR PAPER}
\label{sec:print}

Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, 8.5 x 11-inch white printer
paper. A4 paper is also acceptable, but please leave the extra 0.5 inch (12 mm)
empty at the BOTTOM of the page and follow the top and left margins as
specified.  If the last page of your paper is only partially filled, arrange
the columns so that they are evenly balanced if possible, rather than having
one long column.

In LaTeX, to start a new column (but not a new page) and help balance the
last-page column lengths, you can use the command ``$\backslash$pagebreak'' as
demonstrated on this page (see the LaTeX source below).

\section{PAGE NUMBERING}
\label{sec:page}

Please do {\bf not} paginate your paper.  Page numbers, session numbers, and
conference identification will be inserted when the paper is included in the
proceedings.

\section{ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS}
\label{sec:illust}

Illustrations must appear within the designated margins.  They may span the two
columns.  If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather
than in the middle or at the bottom.  Caption and number every illustration.
All halftone illustrations must be clear black and white prints.  Colors may be
used, but they should be selected so as to be readable when printed on a
black-only printer.

Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of including images (e.g., with
experimental results) in a LaTeX document, below is an example of how to do
this \cite{Lamp86}.

\section{FOOTNOTES}
\label{sec:foot}

Use footnotes sparingly (or not at all!) and place them at the bottom of the
column on the page on which they are referenced. Use Times 9-point type,
single-spaced. To help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and
include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if
you prefer, as in this sentence).

% Below is an example of how to insert images. Delete the ``\vspace'' line,
% uncomment the preceding line ``\centerline...'' and replace ``imageX.ps''
% with a suitable PostScript file name.

\section{COPYRIGHT FORMS}
\label{sec:copyright}

You must include your fully completed, signed IEEE copyright release form when
form when you submit your paper. We {\bf must} have this form before your paper
can be published in the proceedings.

\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:ref}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the
paper. The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or in
order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in
the text, type the corresponding reference number in square
brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{C2}. An
additional final page (the fifth page, in most cases) is
allowed, but must contain only references to the prior
literature.

% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: strings, refs, manuals). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
